What is Weather ?
Weather refers to the atmospheric conditions in a specific location at a particular time, including elements such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. It is the day-to-day variation in the Earth's atmosphere and is influenced by factors such as the sun's radiation, the Earth's rotation, and the distribution of land and water.
Weather conditions can change rapidly, and meteorologists use various instruments and techniques to measure and predict these changes. Common weather phenomena include rain, snow, clouds, thunderstorms, and fog. Weather patterns and climate are related but distinct conceptsâ€”weather describes short-term atmospheric conditions, while climate refers to long-term patterns and averages of weather in a particular region.
